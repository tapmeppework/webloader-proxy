# TODO

## Mandatory
+ **Feature** Enable the control of the delay before each reload.
+ **Feature** Enable a start for each mirror
	+ Not each project start on the homepage. Especially in a development settings
	+ An use case here would to directly start on the admin area (WordPres, Joomla, PrestaShop, ...)

## Nice to have
- **Feature** Use gulp to enable the pre-processing of certain type of files
	- Compression of .css, .js, .html
	- Obfuscation of .js
	- It should be done in a way that the pre-processing can be limited to a specific sub-directory.
	- Hot reload with Gulp
